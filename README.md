# Summary

The Czech-PDT UD treebank is based on the Prague Dependency Treebank – Consolidated
(PDT-C) 2.0, created at the Charles University in Prague.


# Introduction

The treebank consists of 87,907 sentences (1.5 M tokens) and its domain is
mainly newswire, reaching also to business and popular scientific articles
from the 1990s. The treebank is licensed under the terms of
[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
and its original (non-UD) version can be downloaded from
[http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3185](http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3185).

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Czech UD treebank is created
through a conversion of PDT data. The conversion procedure has been designed by
Dan Zeman and implemented in Treex.

# Domains and Data Split

NOTE: While the official release package on Lindat has only one training file
(like other UD treebanks), in the GitHub repository the file is split to
smaller parts because of GitHub file size restrictions. The four files
correspond to the four sources of the original texts; even in the merged file
the sources may still be distinguished, if desirable, by the prefixes of
sentence ids. All of them are newspapers, but

* l (ln) and m (mf) are mainstream daily papers (news, commentaries, but also
  sports results and TV programs)
* c (cmpr) is a business weekly
* v (vesm) contains popular scientific articles (the hardest to parse: long
  sentences and unusual vocabulary)

The dev and test sets contain all four sources and their size is proportional
to the sizes of the respective training parts.


## Source of annotations

This table summarizes the origins and checking of the various columns of the CoNLL-U data.

| Column | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| ID     | Sentence segmentation and (surface) tokenization was automatically done and then hand-corrected; see [PDT documentation](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/doc/pdt-guide/en/html/ch02.html). Splitting of fused tokens into syntactic words was done automatically during PDT-to-UD conversion. |
| FORM   | Identical to Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 form. |
| LEMMA  | Manual selection from possibilities provided by morphological analysis: two annotators and then an arbiter. PDT-to-UD conversion stripped from lemmas the ID numbers distinguishing homonyms, semantic tags and comments; this information is preserved as attributes in the MISC column. |
| UPOS   | Converted automatically from XPOS (via [Interset](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/interset)), from the semantic tags in PDT lemma, and occasionally from other information available in the treebank; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| XPOS   | Manual selection from possibilities provided by morphological analysis: two annotators and then an arbiter. |
| FEATS  | Converted automatically from XPOS (via Interset), from the semantic tags in PDT lemma, and occasionally from other information available in the treebank; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| HEAD   | Original PDT annotation is manual, done by two independent annotators and then an arbiter. Automatic conversion to UD; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| DEPREL | Original PDT annotation is manual, done by two independent annotators and then an arbiter. Automatic conversion to UD; human checking of patterns revealed by automatic consistency tests. |
| DEPS   | Generated from the basic UD tree and additional annotation from the original PDT. |
| MISC   | Information about token spacing taken from PDT annotation. Lemma / word sense IDs, semantic tags and comments on meaning moved here from the PDT lemma. Some other annotation from PDT, such as coreference and functors (for parts of the corpus). |

The original PDT has four layers of annotation: word layer, morphological layer,
analytical (surface-syntactic) layer, and tectogrammatical (deep-syntactic) layer;
they are also referred to as w-, m-, a-, and t-layer. Until UD release 2.11, the
conversion was based only on the first three layers. From release 2.12 on, the
conversion procedure also uses information from the t-layer. Note that this layer
of annotation is not available for the entire treebank but only for a part of it.
Sentences for which the t-layer was available can be recognized by the sentence-
level comment "Tectogrammatical annotation available." Some attributes specific
to the t-layer are ported to the MISC column of the CoNLL-U file:

* Functor ... The tectogrammatical functor of this node w.r.t. its parent in the
  t-tree. It often corresponds to the parent in the UD tree but it is not always
  the case.
* Entity ... Coreference annotation in the [CorefUD](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/corefud)
  format. While the format could be also used for named entity annotation, named
  entities are annotated only if it is needed for coreference.
* Bridging ... Annotation of bridging relations in the CorefUD format.

Furthermore, conversion of syntactic annotation may occasionally differ from what
it would look like without the tectogrammatical input. This is especially true of
the enhanced dependency graph.
